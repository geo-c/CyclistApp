# CyclistApp

Cyclist App is a mobile app for tracking urban bicycle trips. It uses mobile location technologies to record common places visited by cyclists,
their paths, and their perceptions through tagging. For designing and running between-groups experiments, the app can be configured into 
two different versions and assigned to distinct groups of users.

Technically, the app uses a Parse Community back-end service for application data storage and off-line processing. 
It also uses the [Google Fit API](https://developers.google.com/fit/) for gathering location, speed and distance data. 
It offers a leaderboard that uses user's location to estimate positions and a score section that compares users' trips 
with those made in their city.
